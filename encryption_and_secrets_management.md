# Encryption and Secrets Management

## Objectives
- Ensure sensitive data (credentials, API keys, tokens, test data) is protected throughout development, testing, and CI/CD.
- Prevent accidental leaks of secrets or sensitive info in code, logs, or reports.

## Secret Management
- **Never commit real secrets or credentials** to the repository.
- Use `.env` files for local development and add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
- Use GitHub Secrets or a secure secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for CI/CD pipelines.
- Rotate secrets regularly and after personnel changes.

## Test Data Encryption
- If test data contains sensitive information, encrypt the data files (e.g., with GPG or OpenSSL) and store them securely.
- Store decryption keys securely outside of source control.
- Decrypt test data only as needed during automated testing or local runs.

## Environment Variables
- Store API tokens, credentials, and encryption keys in environment variables.
- Reference these variables in test code (never hard-code secrets).
- Provide a `.env.example` file with placeholder values, never with real secrets.

## Reports and Artifacts
- If test reports or logs contain sensitive data, encrypt them before archiving or uploading.
- Restrict access to CI/CD artifacts to authorized team members.

## Communication Security
- Use encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all interactions with remote services and device farms.
- Do not log sensitive secrets to the console or CI logs.

## Auditing & Compliance
- Regularly review the repository and CI configuration for accidental leaks.
- Scan for accidentally committed secrets using tools like [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/) or [truffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog).
- Rotate and revoke secrets immediately if a leak is suspected.
