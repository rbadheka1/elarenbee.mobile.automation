# Test Automation Strategy

## Objectives
- Document the goals and scope of automation for this project.
- Define supported platforms, devices, and OS versions.
- List tools and frameworks (e.g., Appium, Selenium, pytest, etc.).

## Scope
- In-scope: Regression, smoke, and end-to-end tests on Android and iOS.
- Out-of-scope: Manual exploratory testing.

## Approach
- **Framework:** Page Object Model
- **Languages:** Python (or your project language)
- **Test Levels:** API, UI, integration
- **Test Data:** Managed externally in `/data/`

## Execution
- CI integration with GitHub Actions/Jenkins.
- Parallel execution on device farm/emulators.

## Reporting
- Standardized reports in `/reports/`.
- Integration with CI for pass/fail and trend analysis.

## Maintenance
- Locators centralized in `/page_objects/`.
- Regular review of flaky tests and obsolete scripts.

## Risks & Mitigation
- Device fragmentation: Use device cloud services.
- Locator brittleness: Prefer unique IDs over XPaths.
