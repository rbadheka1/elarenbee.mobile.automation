# Test Maintenance Plan

## Review Cycle
- Bi-weekly review of failed/flaky tests.
- Quarterly review for deprecated or redundant scripts.

## Process
- Deactivate failing tests if root cause is not quickly fixable and log a ticket.
- Update locators and dependencies as app UI changes.

## Ownership
- Assign automation owner for each test module.

## Version Control
- All test changes require code review via PR.

_Keeping tests healthy is essential for reliable automation._
